This patch adds the following features to the Game Boy game "Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3":

* Select world, level and powerup
* With 1.1.1 able to fight bosses (thus disables overworld movement - that's how the game works Q.Q)
* [Save states](https://github.com/mattcurrie/gb-save-states) (`[Start]+[↓]/[↑]` or `[Select]+[A]/[B]`)
* Soft reset (`[Start]+[Select]+[A]+[B]`) always available, even when original game disallows it.

## IMPORTANT BEFORE PLAYING
If you see the bosses still being beaten after booting up the ROM, you **must** delete the old savefile (.sav File)  
from previous versions in order to fully work.  

## Download

The latest release can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/lightbulb-sun/sml3-practice-rom/releases).
